                        <p>
                            In data mining applications, the lack of labeled data makes supervised learning
                            algorithms fail to build accurate classification models. Transfer learning has been
                            developed to deal with such lack of label problem. It aims to improve the
                            performance of learning by transferring knowledge from several source domains to a
                            target domain. For example, image classification can be modeled as a target learning
                            task where there are only a few labeled training images. Fortunately, it is possible
                            to collect some texts related to images, such as image annotations or documents
                            around images, so that the knowledge from text data (a source domain) can be
                            transferred to classify images in a target domain.
